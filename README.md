The unofficial but great `Remnote for Desktop` is out now, created by ![Author](https://img.shields.io/badge/CosmicIceDev-gray?style=for-the-badge&logo=ice)

Currently, I only have the windows version as I do not own a Computer with Mac OS neither Linux.

So, if you are a Mac OS/Linux user, and a developer, you can contribute to this project by building versions for the respective operating systems using my code.

Do note that, when installing, Windows will give you a `Smart Screen` message saying this app is not licensed, and that is because, Windows expects me to pay for licensing it, but i can't, so sorry about that. :)

Thank you for using Remnote for Desktop. Do note that you will still need internet to use it, as I do not have the files to make it offline. I will need Remnote's permission and they'll have to give it to me.
